## Quick Start

Your goal is to build Rome from a small settlement into a mighty empire. Each season (turn), you'll manage resources, make decisions about taxation, military, trade, and expansion. The game ends when you achieve a victory condition or fail one of the failure conditions.

**Starting Resources:**
- 500 Denarii (gold)
- 120 Grain (survives first winter if you act early)
- 100 Population
- 70% Happiness
- 25 Troops
- 80% Morale
- 150 Housing, 150 Grain Storage
- 50 Sanitation
- 1 Fort, 50 Supplies

**First 5 Turns Checklist (CRITICAL for survival):**
1. **Turn 1: Build Farm Complex (180d)** - CRITICAL! Doubles grain production to 6/season
2. Set tax rate to 12-15%
3. Research Irrigation technology (+20% grain)
4. Keep happiness above 60%
5. Don't recruit more troops yet (expensive upkeep)

> **Warning:** Without the Farm Complex, you WILL starve in Winter! Build it Turn 1.

---

## Resource Management

### Resource Types & Uses

| Resource | Base Price | Category | Primary Uses |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| Grain | 8d | Food | Population/troop food, trade, feasts |
| Timber | 12d | Basic | Building construction, crafting |
| Stone | 15d | Basic | Building construction, wonders |
| Clay | 10d | Basic | Construction, monuments |
| Wool | 18d | Basic | Trade commodity |
| Livestock | 30d | Food | Population growth, sacrifices |
| Salt | 20d | Strategic | Trade, supply caches |
| Iron | 25d | Strategic | Weapons, technology |
| Wine | 35d | Luxury | High-value trade, festivals |
| Olive Oil | 40d | Luxury | High-value trade |
| Spices | 60d | Luxury | Highest trade value |

### Food Consumption Formula

```
Per Season = (Population × 0.42) + (Troops × 0.55)
```

**Example:** 200 population + 50 troops = 84 + 27.5 = ~112 grain/season

**Starvation Consequences:**
- -15% population per starvation round
- -15 morale
- 2+ consecutive = Game Over (Famine)

### Production Multipliers

| Source | Multiplier Range |
|--------|------------------|
| Territory Level | 1.0x (Level 1) to 3.0x (Level 5) |
| Rarity | 1.0x (Common) to 3.0x (Imperial) |
| Season | -25% (Winter) to +15% (Summer) |
| Technology | +15% to +30% per relevant tech |
| Governor | +10% to +30% based on trait |

---

## Economy & Taxation

### Income Sources

1. **Taxation** (Primary)
   ```
   Tax Income = Population × Tax Rate × 7
   ```
   - Diminishing returns above 20% rate
   - Modified by territory stability
   - Banking tech adds +15%

2. **Territory Income**
   ```
   Territory Income = Owned Territories × Average Population × 0.5
   ```

3. **Trade Profits** (see Trade section)

4. **Wonder Income** (Forum Romanum: +500/season)

### Upkeep Costs

```
Total Upkeep = Buildings + Military + Infrastructure
- Buildings: Sum of all structure upkeep costs
- Military: Troops × 2 denarii
- Infrastructure: (Housing ÷ 15) + (Forts × 4) + (Sanitation ÷ 8)
```

**Seasonal modifier:** Winter adds +25% upkeep

### Tax Rate Strategy

| Rate | Income | Happiness Impact | Recommendation |
|------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| 5-10% | Low | None | Early game safety |
| 10-15% | Moderate | Minimal | **Optimal balance** |
| 15-20% | Good | -5% happiness | Mid-game boost |
| 20%+ | High | -10%+ happiness | Emergency only |

**Early Game Grace Period:**
- Rounds 1-8: 60% of normal food consumption (first 2 years)
- Rounds 9-14: 80% of normal food consumption
- Rounds 15+: Full consumption

## Military System

### Unit Recruitment

| Unit | Cost | Food | Troops Gained | Best For |
|------|------|------|---------------|----------|
| Militia | 80d | 5 | 9-11 | Early fodder |
| Auxiliaries | 100d | 7 | 12-14 | Cost efficiency |
| Archers | 120d | 6 | 11-14 | Ranged support |
| Legionaries | 140d | 8 | 14-16 | Standard warfare |
| Cavalry | 250d | 12 | 23-27 | Elite strikes |
| Praetorian Guard | 400d | 15 | 40-45 | Ultimate power |

### Battle Mechanics

**Your Strength Calculation:**
```
Strength = Troops × (Morale / 100) × Tech Bonus × Supply Bonus
```

- Supply Bonus: If supplies > 100, gain up to +20% strength
- Tech Bonus: Legion Formation (+20%), Iron Forge (+10%), Tactics (+15%)
- Maximum tech multiplier: 1.5x

**Enemy Strength:**
```
Enemy = 30 + (Round × 2) + (Your Territories × 3) + Difficulty
```

**Win Odds:**
```
Odds = Your Strength / (Your Strength + Enemy Strength)
```

**Target:** Aim for 60%+ odds before attacking

### Casualties

- **Victory:** 10-30% of troops engaged
- **Defeat:** 30-50% of troops lost
- Mars Tier 100 blessing: -30% casualties

## Territory Management

### Territory Levels

| Level | Name | Production | Stability Bonus | Upgrade Cost |
|-------|------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Settlement (Vicus) | 1.0x | +0 | - |
| 2 | Town (Oppidum) | 1.2x | +5 | 400d |
| 3 | City (Urbs) | 1.5x | +10 | 800d |
| 4 | Metropolis | 2.0x | +15 | 1,500d |
| 5 | Capital Province | 3.0x | +25 | 3,000d |

**Strategy:** Focus 3-4 core territories to Level 5 rather than spreading thin.

### Territory Buildings

| Building | Cost | Effects |
|----------|------|---------|
| Garrison | 300d | +15 defense, +10 stability, +50 troop capacity |
| Walls | 500d | +30 defense, +15 stability |
| Arena | 350d | +15 happiness, +8 stability |
| Roads | 400d | -15% trade risk, +10% income |

| Watchtower | 250d | +20 defense, +5 stability |
| Granary | 350d | +100 food storage |
| Census Office | 180d | +10% tax efficiency, -5 stability |

### Governors

| Governor | Bonus | Malus | Cost | Best For |
|----------|-------|-------|------|----------|
| Marcus (Merchant) | +20% income | -10% defense | 200d | Trade hubs |
| Titus (General) | +25% defense, +15% morale | -10% income | 250d | Border defense |
| Lucius (Scholar) | +20% tech discount | -15% defense | 200d | Research focus |

| Servius (Priest) | +30% piety, +10% happiness | -15% income | 200d | Religious focus |

### Territory Focus (300d each)

| Focus | Bonuses |
|-------|---------|
| Military Outpost | +30% defense, +20% troop recruitment |
| Trade Hub | +15% trade prices, +20% tariff reduction |
| Breadbasket | +50% grain production |
| Mining District | +50% iron, +30% stone production |

### Garrison System

- Base capacity: 50 troops per territory
- Garrison building: +50 capacity each
- Garrison troops provide stability (+1 per 10 troops)
- Under-garrisoned territories lose stability each season

### Territory Stability Formula

Stability affects tax income, rebellion risk, and territory productivity.

**Per-Season Stability Change:**
```
Base Change = garrison > 20 ? +1 : -2
Building Bonus = (Arena +8 + Walls +15 + Forum +10 + etc.) ÷ 4
Governor Bonus = territory.stability × governor.stability_bonus ÷ 4
God Bonus = Jupiter blessing at tier 75 (+20% stability)

Final Change = Base + Building Bonus + Governor Bonus + God Bonus
```

**Stability Effects:**
| Stability | Tax Efficiency | Rebellion Risk | Production |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| 80-100 | Full | 0% | +10% bonus |
| 60-79 | 90% | 0% | Normal |
| 40-59 | 75% | 5% per season | -10% |
| 20-39 | 50% | 10% per season | -25% |
| 0-19 | 25% | 20% per season | -50% |

**Tip:** Assign Gaius (Administrator) to unstable territories (+20% stability).

---

## Population Growth

### Population Growth Formula

```
Base Growth Rate = 2% per season

Modifiers:
× (1 + Venus blessing)     // +25% at tier 50
× (0.5 + happiness/100)    // 50-150% based on happiness
× sanitation_mod           // See below
× tech_mod                 // Medicine +15%

Sanitation Effects:
- 50+: Normal growth
- 30-49: 50% growth rate
- Below 30: No growth, risk of decline
- Below 15: -1% population decline

Housing Cap:
Growth = min(calculated_growth, housing - population)
```

**Example - City of Glory Planning:**
- Starting: 100 population
- With Venus (tier 50), high happiness (80%), good sanitation:
  - Growth rate: 2% × 1.25 × 1.3 = ~3.25% per season
  - ~3 population per season
  - 350 pop requires ~250 growth = ~83 seasons without tech
- With Medicine tech (+15%):
  - ~3.7 population per season
  - 350 pop in ~68 seasons

**Tips for Population Growth:**
1. Keep happiness above 70% (+20% growth)
2. Research Medicine early (+15%)
3. Worship Venus for +25% growth
4. Build housing before you need it
5. Keep sanitation above 50
